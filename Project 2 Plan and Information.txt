Project Plan
1. Open the music file and read it
2. Determine at which points in the music will the object that is moving change to 
3. Make the object (determine if it will be 2D or 3D)
4. Make the movements of the object
5. Connect the two so that the object moves with the different sounds and wavelengths of the music
6. Make a viewing window where you can see the object moving with the music
